# Capture-Recapture with Bayesian statistics
#### Loreleï Guéry, July 2020

This course was initially developed for a workshop inside the CISEF consortium, project funded by AOTTP-ICCAT.

## Outline

1. Bayesian Capture-Recapture models in closed population
  * Exercise 1: Fit Model M0 to the bear data using JAGS and data augmentation
2. Spatially Explicit Capture Recapture (SECR) models

## Slides, code and data

* All material is prepared in `R`
* `R Markdown` is used to write reproducible material (`R` code also available).
* Material available via Github [here](https://github.com/LGuery/Bayesian_Workshop_AOTTP).

## Credits

* Many slides are largely inspired by Workshops material shared by Andy Royle and the Biometrics Working Group [\alert{there}](https://sites.google.com/site/spatialcapturerecapture/workshop-athens-2016) or [\alert{there}](https://sites.google.com/site/spatialcapturerecapture/workshop-tws17)

* I also use a lot of materials shared by [\alert{Olivier Gimenez}](https://github.com/oliviergimenez/Bayesian_Workshop), [\alert{Murray Efford}](https://www.otago.ac.nz/density/pdfs/secr-tutorial.pdf) and \alert{Andy Royle} [\alert{here}](https://www.stat.colostate.edu/graybillconference2014/Presentations/Royle.pdf) and [\alert{there}](https://slideplayer.com/slide/10008078/)

## Requirements

* You need to have `R` or `RStudio` installed.
* Download `Jags` from [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/) and install it.
- Install package `R2jags` from `R` or `RStudio`.
